// The host socket over HTTP: a guarded JSON route that issues a one-time
// ticket, and the WebSocket upgrade that redeems it. A browser WebSocket
// cannot send the API token header, so the ticket stands in for it, and
// the socket path is exempt from the /api/* token guard (app.js).
// What travels on the socket: host-socket/host-socket.js.
//
// A ticket is bound to whoever asked for it (the request's `principal`,
// set by the listener's guard): a paired device's socket may send only what
// its scopes allow, is refused if its session ended before the ticket was
// redeemed, and closes when the session is revoked.

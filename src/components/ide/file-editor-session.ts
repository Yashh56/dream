/**
 * The Files panel's open files, one session per project, outside React.
 *
 * A session owns a project's file tabs, the buffer of each open text file
 * (what is on disk and the unsaved draft), how each was read, and a pending
 * reveal for the editor. It reads a file when its tab is showing, writes it
 * on save, forgets it when its tab closes, and keeps unsaved drafts through
 * a refresh. Panels are views: they render a session's snapshot and call its
 * actions, so a panel that remounts (its host went away and came back)
 * finds its drafts where it left them.
 *
 * This module knows nothing of the store. The store creates the sessions,
 * opens files through `openProjectFile` (which resolves the path and calls
 * the project's session), and tells the sessions when a project's files
 * changed on disk (`refresh`) or when a project stopped being open (`drop`).
 * Errors are kept as thrown, for the panel to put into words.

/**
 * Removing a browser client's connection to its home host: what "sign out
 * of this host" does, as opposed to a temporary disconnect.
 *
 *   - The session ends on the host (it clears the HttpOnly cookie this page
 *     cannot touch), so the credential is gone even if this device is not.
 *   - The client's own workspace (IndexedDB: layout, drafts, cached project
 *     rows) is cleared, and the host socket closed.
 *
 * A temporary disconnect does none of this: drafts and cached rows stay
 * readable until the host is back. The desktop's SSH hosts are removed by
 * the store (host-actions.ts removeSshHost), whose credentials live in the
 * main process. Reloading the page afterwards is the caller's choice, and
 * drops what the page holds in memory (transcripts, caches).

/**
 * One connection supervisor per client: the state of its connection to
 * each host, and the lifecycle signals (foregrounding, coming back online)
 * that tell the host sockets, catalogs and streams to check theirs.
 *
 * Connection state is about the transport and the credential only:
 *
 *   connecting     a first attempt is under way
 *   ready          requests reach the host and are authorized
 *   reconnecting   it was ready; the host is unreachable for now
 *   unauthorized   the host refused this client's credential (revoked,
 *                  expired, never paired): retrying will not help
 *   incompatible   the host is not one this client may use (another host,
 *                  a protocol it does not speak): retrying will not help
 *   offline        not reachable, and not known to have been ready
 *
 * Whether the host's catalog is loaded is separate (the store's catalog
 * lifecycle, store/host-catalog-lifecycle.ts): a ready connection can still
 * be loading its catalog.
 *
 * Who decides a host's state depends on its route. A browser client's
 * home host is judged by its own requests (`report`). A desktop SSH host
 * is judged by the main process, which owns the ssh session (`set`, from
 * its status events); requests through the desktop's proxy do not
 * override that.
 *
 * Pure apart from the lifecycle port, which is injected.
